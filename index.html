      <p>
        The <cite>Web Telephony API</cite> allows applications to manage
        interaction with telephony call signaling, but does not handle audio
        channels management.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of making a telephony call is provided below:
      </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
    var telCall = navigator.telephony.dial('+1234567890');

    telCall.onactive = function(e) {
        window.console.log('Connected!');
    }

    telCall.ondisconnected = function(e) {
        window.console.log('Disconnected!');
        // update call history
    }

    telCall.onerror = function(e) {
        window.console.error(e);
    }
</pre>
      <p>
        The use cases for this specification are collected in the <a href=
        'http://www.w3.org/wiki/System_Applications_WG:_Telephony_API'>wiki
        page</a> of this API.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following specifications informed the design of the <cite>Web
        Telephony API</cite>: for <abbr title=
        "Global System for Mobile Communications">GSM</abbr> the [[!GSM-CALL]]
        suite, for IMS/SIP the [[!IMS]] suite, for <abbr title=
        "Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ">XMPP</abbr> the
        [[!JINGLE]] specification. Note, however, that IMS/SIP and XMPP are not
        supported in this version.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is likely that the same API would work also for <abbr title=
        "Session Initiation Protocol">SIP</abbr> and <abbr title=
        "Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ">XMPP</abbr> calls with
        the exception of multiparty call handling, which is modeled after the
        cellular multiparty calls. Future versions of this specification will
        probably add <abbr title="Session Initiation Protocol">SIP</abbr> and
        <abbr title="Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ">XMPP</abbr>
        conference support.

      <h2>
        Telephony services
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>telephony service</dfn> manages telephony operations associated
        with a subscriber identity, which is registered with a telephony
        service provider. For example, in cellular telephony, a telephony
        service is associated with <abbr title=
        "Subscriber Identity Module">SIM</abbr> card (Subscriber Identity
        Module). A telephony service can use different protocols for telephony
        signaling and media (e.g. GSM, CDMA, VoLTE, etc.) with the same
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each telephony service has a unique <dfn>telephony service id</dfn>,
        which identifies a <a>telephony service</a> together with a user
        identity in the system. For telephony services that make use of a SIM
        card, it is RECOMMEDED that the ICC-ID be used for the service
        identifier.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is strongly RECOMMENDED a implementations <strong>do not</strong>
        use use the MSISDN as the telephony service id. The <abbr title=
        "Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network-Number">MSISDN</abbr>
        cannot guarantee uniqueness.
      </p>
      <p>
        A user agent can access zero or more <a>telephony services</a>. Which
        telephony services are available to the user agent is dictated by
        policy, or by the user choosing which services are available to the
        user agent. When one or more telephony services is available to the
        user agent, one serves as the <a>default telephony service</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the API, telephony services are represented by a DOMString that maps
        to a <a>telephony service id</a> for each <a>telephony service</a>
        available to an <a>origin</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to a telephony service by any <a>origin</a> is restricted by a
        security policy. See the <a>security and privacy considerations</a>
        section for more details.
      </p>
      <p>
        A telephony service observes the <a title="call state">call states</a>
        of a <a>telephony call</a> in the supported telephony backend(s) and
        networks and reflects those changes in the API through [[!DOM4]]
        events.

        <h3>
          Changing telephony services
        </h3>
        <p>
          Telephony services can be added or removed from the system at any
          time (e.g., the user pops out the SIM card or adds a different SIM
          card; the user tells the system to only allow certain applications to
          access a particular telephony service, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          When a <a>telephony service</a> is either added or removed in the
          system, the user agent MUST run the steps to change the telephony
          service:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>name</var> be <code>serviceremoved</code> if the
          telephony service was removed, or <code>serviceadded</code>
          otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>Let <var>event</var> be a new <a>TelephonyServiceEvent</a>, with
          <var>name</var> as the event name, which does not bubble, is not
          cancelable, has no default action, and whose <a>serviceId</a>
          attribute is set to the <a>telephony service id</a> of the
          <a>telephony service</a> that initiated this algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>If the service has been removed and it's the default telephony
          service for the <a>origin</a>, then change default telephony service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire an event</a> <var>event</var> at the

        <p>
          The <dfn>default telephony service</dfn> is the <a>telephony
          service</a> that serves as default for telephony operations for the
          <a>origin</a> of an application. The default telephony service can be
          changed by the user, and if supported, through the
          <a>changeDefaultService()</a> method of the <a>TelephonyManager</a>
          object.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is no <a>default telephony service</a> for the
          <a>origin</a>, the user agent SHOULD use the system's default
          telephony service, if available and if allowed by policy. If there
          are no telephony services available to use as the default for the
          origin, the default telephony service is null.
        </p>
        <p>
          When there is a need to <dfn>changes default telephony service</dfn>,
          the user agent MUST:

        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>service id</var> be the <a>telephony service id</a> of

          A <dfn id="telephony-call-concept">telephony call</dfn> results from
          a <dfn>telephony service</dfn>'s attempt to establish a connection

          call</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>telephony call</dfn> is always in some call state, which can
          change over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Telephony calls initiated by a telephony service of the system is an
          <dfn>outbound call</dfn>. Conversely, a telephony calls from a remote
          party is an <dfn>inbound call</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every telephony call has a <dfn>call id</dfn>, which is a string that

        <p>
          An <dfn>active call</dfn> is a <a>Call</a> in the <a>active</a> state
          representing a connected call which is bound to the media input and
          output devices (e.g. microphone, speaker, tone generator). Note that
          a call on <a>hold</a> is also active from a call signaling point of

          Since call state transitions depend on protocol, network equipment,

          erroneous state transitions. MUST always re-synchronize any eventual
          internal states to the current call state reported by the telephony
          system. The implementation MUST NOT set the call state to any other
          value than specified in the descriptions of the methods of this
          interface.

          Multiparty calls
        </h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>multiparty call</dfn> (also referred to as <dfn>conference
          call</dfn>) is a <a>telephony call</a> with multiple remote party
          participants, which is controlled as a single telephony call, i.e. it
          can be <a>held</a>, <a>activated</a>, <a>disconnected</a> from all
          participants. Other calls can be joined with a multiparty call.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the API, multiparty calls are represented by objects that
          implement the <a>ConferenceCall</a> interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          This of the API version supports GSM multiparty calls and CDMA 3-way
          calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>conference id</dfn> uniquely identifies a <a>multiparty
          call</a> in the system and in call history.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>remote party id</dfn> uniquely identifies a participant
          (a.k.a. remote party) in a telephony call in the given <a>telephony
          service</a>, such as a phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Event handler called when a new participant has been added to the
          conference call as a result of the <a>createConference</a> method,
          and the <code>participantadded</code> event is dispatched.
        </p>
        <p>
          For multiparty calls, the implementation MUST generate a unique
          identifier stored in the <code>callId</code> attribute. In GSM, the
          <code>callId</code> of any participating call could be used in a
          multiparty operation, and the telephony network will reply with using
          the same value. But for forward compatibility reasons, the
          implementation MUST generate a separate <code>callId</code> value for
          the multiparty call, which MUST be unique in the system and the local
          call history. For GSM multiparty functionality, The implementation
          MUST map this to an appropriate transaction identifier accepted by
          the telephony service. Also, the transaction identifiers received
          from the network MUST be mapped back by the implementation to the
          unique conference call identifier of the multiparty call.

          The <code>dial()</code> method
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>dial()</dfn> method initiates a new <a>telephony call</a>.
          When invoked the user agent MUST run the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol id="steps-dial">
          <li>Create a new <a>TelephonyCall</a> object, referred as
          <var>telCall</var> in these steps.
          </li>
          <li>Set the <a>remoteParty</a> attribute of <var>telCall</var> to the
          <a>remote party id</a> specified in the <a>remoteParty</a> parameter.
          </li>
          <li>If <a>calls</a> array already contains a <a>TelephonyCall</a>
          object with identical <a>remoteParty</a> attribute, then an
          <code>InvalidModificationError</code> MUST be thrown.
          </li>
          <li>Otherwise, make a request to the telephony system to dial in the
          <a>remote party id</a> passed in the <var>remoteParty</var>
          parameter. Note that the value can be also an emergency number.
          According to the value of the <code>hideCallerId</code> in the <code>
            params</code> parameter, the own number is requested to be either
            displayed, hidden or otherwise the default system configuration to
            this regard is requested to be followed. The call MUST be made
            using the <a>telephony service</a> specified in the
            <code>service</code> member of the <code>params</code> arguement.
            If not specified, then the implementation MUST use the <a>default
            telephony service</a>. Even if there is no SIM card and no other
            telephony services are available, but emergency calls are known to
            be possible (e.g. because a cellular modem is present), it is
            considered as a default service with only emergency call
            capability, and the implementation MUST define a <a>telephony
            service id</a> for it. When not even emergency calls are possible
            (e.g. it is a purely IP based implementation and there is no
            cellular modem), the implementation MAY use empty string for
            default <a>telephony service id</a>, but it is encouraged that a
            default service is created, with the methods throwing a
            <code>NotSupported</code> error.
          </li>
          <li>If the request is successful, then
            <ol>
              <li>Set the <code>state</code> of <var>telCall</var> to
              <code>"dialing"</code> value.
              </li>
              <li>Add <var>telCall</var> to the <a>calls</a> array.

      ## Multiparty call sequences and states

          GSM TS 24.084.
          "There are four auxiliary states associated with the MPTY service:
          - Idle;
          - MPTY request; A request has been made to add this call to the MPTY.
          - Call in MPTY; This call is in the MPTY.
          - Split request; A request has been made to remove this call from the MPTY.
          These Auxiliary states apply in addition to the GSM 04.08 call control
          states and the GSM 04.83 call hold states. Thus for example, an active
          call in a held MPTY has the state (Active, Call held, Call in MPTY).
          Not all states are allowed, for example an MPTY cannot be split while
          it is held, so (Active, Call held, Split request) is forbidden."

          Instead of this, we offer a model when states describe valid multiparty
          states. Valid state transitions for a multiparty call are:
          * joining -> active
          * active -> holding -> held
          * held -> resuming -> active (connected)
          * any state -> [disconnecting]-> disconnected

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">
          On received calls, telephony protocols also use a
          <code>"ringing"</code> state, set by the mobile terminal when local
          call alerting starts, in order to notify the remote party about the
          ongoing alerting (ringing can actually be e.g. a beep, ring tone, or
          vibration pattern). This is considered to be responsibility of
          implementations: if the modem expects this state to be set,
          implementations MUST make sure to set it. Dialer applications are not
          expected to set this state in the current version of the
          specification.
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
          CDMA cannot report all these states in the expected sequence. The
          ‘connected’ state (i.e. when the mobile station send the Service
          Connect Completion Message or Connect Order, depending on whether the
          call is mobile originated or terminated) is immediately followed by
          voice media transmission – there is transition to ‘active’ before the
          media arrives. Therefore it should be up to the implementation to
          determine which events to fire and in which order. Dialer
          applications need to be prepared to handle such cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          For call setup on dialed calls, the following call states MUST be
          supported in this order:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <code>"dialing"</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>"alerting"</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>"active"</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">
          On the telephony services which support the <code>"connecting"</code>
          call state (e.g. GSM and CDMA, for call routing, forwarding,
          voicemail handling etc), implementations SHOULD support this state
          too, between the <code>"dialing"</code> and <code>"alerting"</code>
          states. Dialer applications can associate the protocol with the
          <a>telephony service</a> used for the call.
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
          It is under discussion whether a system message should be propagated
          when a CDMA telephony call is active, since not all CDMA networks
          support concurrent services. Therefore, many applications will lose
          their data connection when the end user is in a voice call.

        <p>
          When a call monitoring task, previously referred to as
          <a><var>TCallControl</var></a> is notified that a dialed call is in
          the process of being connected, it MUST set <code>state</code> to
          <code>"connecting"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <a><var>TCallControl</var></a> is informed that the connection
          has been established and the call is active, it MUST set
          <code>state</code> to <code>"active"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is any error during method calls, then the <a>error
          steps</a> MUST be executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the protocol, there may be restrictions on methods. For
          instance, GSM does not permit disconnecting a held call. Also,
          disconnecting a participant in a held multiparty call is not
          supported. In such case, the <a>error steps</a> MUST be executed.
          Also, if the controlling party disconnects in IS-41 3-way call in

        The <a>CallHistoryEntry</a> interface describes the minimum set of
        properties which a user agent would need to support for call history
        entries. For multiparty call there needs to be a separate

        same value for the <a>conferenceId</a> attribute.

        It is up the the implementations and applications how to store and
        access call history. This document only specifies the minimum content
        of the data to be saved.
